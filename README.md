# Mixtape Playlist
Have a list of songs, but don't want to add them one by one into a playlist? Same! Hold on let me figure out how to make this work brb

## Notes
Based on the [Spotify Web API Quick Start guide](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/quick-start/).

It's not mentioned in the guide, but for development, you'll need to add `http://localhost:8888/callback` to the **Redirect URIs whitelist** (Dashboard > Applications > Your application > Edit Settings > Redirect URIs).
